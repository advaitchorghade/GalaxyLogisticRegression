# Galaxy Logistic Regression

I am planning to use logistic classification to predict a galaxy from other images.

I plan to predct a spiral galaxy, like the Milky Way, verses other galaxy types. 

Our data has split the types of galaxies in 10 catagorgories. 

-disk, face-on, No spiral
-smooth, completely round
-smooth in between round
-smooth, cigar shaped
-disk edge on rounded bulge
-disk, edge on, boxy bulge
-disk edge on no bulge
-disk, face on, tight spiral 
-disk, face on med spiral
-disk, face on loose spiral

It is thought the milky way is of *disk, face on, tight spiral* or *disk, face on med spiral*.

Logistic regression or classification is a binary classification, hence we cannot detect multiple classifications. Therefore, I have decided to differentiate between 'milky way' like galaxies and 'not milky way' galaxies. 

With this complete, I now plan to classify individual galaxies instead of binary classification.
